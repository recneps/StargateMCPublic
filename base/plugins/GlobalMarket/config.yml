# Persistence options. Valid options are 'flat' and 'redis' (Default: flat)

# If using a multi-server setup, set 'persistence.saveInterval' to zero on all but one server.
# If changed while the server is running, for example from flat to redis, GlobalMarket will /ERASE/
# the new storage method and import all loaded data into it from the previous persistance method.
